# Punnett-Squares

This is a program that, from the parental genotypes, calculates the genotypic and phenotypic ratios of the offspring

There are multiple versions of the program uploaded, some as .py and some as .exe
The most recent is the file name ending with "efficient" compared to the GUI file, which was added as an original version
More files, with separated functions, soon to arrive
