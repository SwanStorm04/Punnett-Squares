# Punnett-Squares
# This is a program that, from the parental genotypes, calculates the genotypic and phenotypic ratios of the offspring

# To be added:
# X-linked genes
# Incomplete Dominance
# Add genotype/phenotype as probability?
  #Also maybe use how close genes are on chromosome for more accuracy
    #Two applications or windows? When opens, pick simple or complicated one?
